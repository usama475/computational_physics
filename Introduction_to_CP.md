# Introduction to Computational Physics

## What is Computational Physics?

Computational Physics uses computers to solve complex physical problems that cannot be addressed analytically. 
It bridges theoretical predictions and experimental results by applying numerical algorithms.

## Why Use Computational Methods?

- Many physical problems do not have exact solutions.
- Numerical methods approximate solutions efficiently using algorithms.
- Computers enable the simulation of complex systems quickly and accurately.

## Importance of Numerical Methods

- Analyze complex, realistic systems.
- Predict the behavior of physical systems (e.g., planetary motion, fluid dynamics).
- Essential for scientific research, engineering, and technological advancements.
